# Robot-Coin-and-Grid-Problems-

Robot Grid Problem
The input is an n×m board. A robot starts at the upper left cell and wants to move
to the bottom right cell, the (n,m) cell. On each step, the robot can move either one cell to the right or one cell
down from its current location. The program calculates the total number of paths the robot can choose
if some cells on the board are inaccessible for the robot. Inaccessible cells are marked as -1. 

Robot coin collection
A robot, located in the upper left cell of the board, needs to collect as many of the coins as
possible and bring them to the bottom right cell. On each step, the robot can move either one
cell to the right or one cell down from its current location. 
When the robot visits a cell with a coin, it always picks up that coin. 
Input:  n×m board with coins marked as 1
Output: largest number of coins the robot can bring to the cell (n, m)
